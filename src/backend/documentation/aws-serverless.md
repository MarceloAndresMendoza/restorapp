# AWS Serverless Backend
### DynamoDB + API Gateway + Lambda

For this project, you need to create a Serverless Backend on AWS.

1. Create a new DynamoDB table on the region of your preference, check before the closest near your location, considering some limitations on certain services available or not available on your zone. That said, i prefer to use us-east-1 (North Virginia) since for the purpose of this app, I don't need super low latency and I am using some mail services are only available here.
